## server.bat

To create server, just run this file. Works for only Python 3+. Change the command for Python 2. This file won't be merged as it is added to _.gitignore_.

For python 2 just change the content of server.bat to following and run it:
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Though I would suggest to use python 3 to avoid dependency issues with various libraries (for the backend i.e)

## Steps to run

First execute the server.bat file

Next Run the flask server in the python folder using python3
> python python/server.py
